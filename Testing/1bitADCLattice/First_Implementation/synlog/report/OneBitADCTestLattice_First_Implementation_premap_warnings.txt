@W: MT529 :"/home/user/SDR-HLS/Testing/1bitADCLattice/First_Implementation/source/box_ave.v":175:0:175:5|Found inferred clock ADC_top|clk_in which controls 64 sequential elements including SSD_ADC.box_ave.ave_data_out[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
