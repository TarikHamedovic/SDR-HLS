Removed logic
-------------

Block i27 undriven or does not drive anything - clipped.
Block i26 undriven or does not drive anything - clipped.
Signal n6 was merged into signal i_reset_c
Signal n7 was merged into signal i_LVDS_p_c
Signal VCC_net undriven or does not drive anything - clipped.
Signal GND_net undriven or does not drive anything - clipped.
Block i16_1_lut was optimized away.
Block i17_1_lut was optimized away.

     

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is 'i_reset_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components with synchronous local reset also reset by asynchronous GSR
----------------------------------------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to ENABLED and the local reset
     is synchronous. The components will respond to the synchronous local reset
     and to the unrelated asynchronous reset signal 'i_reset_c' via the GSR
     component.

     Type and number of components of the type: 
   Register = 1 

     Type and instance name of component: 
   Register : o_LVDS_6

Run Time and Memory Usage
-------------------------

   Total CPU Time: 2 secs  
   Total REAL Time: 2 secs  
   Peak Memory Usage: 451 MB
