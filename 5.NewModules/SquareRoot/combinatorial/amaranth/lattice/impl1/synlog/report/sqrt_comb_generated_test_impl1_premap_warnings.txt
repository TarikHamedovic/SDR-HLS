@W: MT529 :"/home/user/SDR-HLS/5.NewModules/SquareRoot/combinatorial/amaranth/lattice/impl1/source/sqrt_sequential.sv":26:2:26:10|Found inferred clock sqrt_sequential|clk which controls 72 sequential elements including sqrt_state[1]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
