# SDR-HLS

The github repository delves into the development of a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Re-
ceiver, which is conceptualized to operate on an Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA)
platform utilizing High-Level Synthesis (HLS). This approach is inspired by a notable
project conducted on a Lattice MACHXO2 Board, which demonstrated the feasibility
of receiving AM broadcasts with minimal analog components. The project underscores
the shift towards digital processing within the FPGA, highlighting the importance of a
robust understanding of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for successful implementation.
HLS comes into play as an advantageous methodology for DSP applications, especially
in algorithm-based designs, due to its efficiency in prototyping and testing compared to
traditional Verilog-based development.
