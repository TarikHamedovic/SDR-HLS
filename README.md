# Software Defined Radio(SDR) in High Level Synthesis(HLS)

The github repository delves into the development of a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Receiver, which is conceptualized to operate on an Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) platform utilizing High-Level Synthesis (HLS). This approach is inspired by a [notable project](https://hackaday.io/project/170916-fpga-3-r-1-c-mw-and-sw-sdr-receiver) conducted on a Lattice MACHXO2 Board, which demonstrated the feasibility
of receiving AM broadcasts with minimal analog components. The project underscores the shift towards digital processing within the FPGA, highlighting the importance of a robust understanding of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for successful implementation. HLS comes into play as an advantageous methodology for DSP applications, especially in algorithm-based designs, due to its efficiency in prototyping and testing compared to traditional Verilog-based development.

In the forthcoming sections, we will go into the operational principles of the project, alongside potential enhancements, alterations, and comprehensive discussions on the DSP Modules integral to the SDR Receiver. Additionally, the project’s transition to a different platform, specifically the ULX3S board, will be outlined. Furthermore, the performance and functionality of the SDR Receiver will be evaluated through both Verilog and High-Level Synthesis (HLS) testing methodologies.

The SDR Receiver's architecture starts with an antenna capturing the RF signal, which is then enhanced through oversampling at an 80 MHz FPGA clock to improve signal resolution and quality. The signal passes through a voltage divider into a Sigma-Delta Modulator comprising a comparator (operating with LVDS) and an integrator, marking the system's transition from analog to digital. This stage outputs a 1-bit data stream, which is mixed with quadrature sine and cosine waves generated by a Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO). The NCO's frequency is dynamically adjustable via a UART PC connection, matching the desired carrier wave frequency.

The mixed signal, encoded with Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), is filtered through a Cascaded Integrator-Comb (CIC) filter, implementing low-pass filtering and decimation (reducing the sample rate by 1/4096). Subsequently, the signal is demodulated (AM), converted into a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal tailored for audio output, and finally amplified to drive speakers for sound reproduction. This process illustrates the fusion of analog and digital techniques in a modern SDR receiver for high-quality audio.

# ULX3S FPGA Board

The board used for this project is the ULX3S FPGA Board. It is a fully open-source development board for LATTICE ECP5 FPGAs. The board has extensive documentation on its GitHub, with [manuals](https://github.com/emard/ulx3s/blob/master/doc/MANUAL.md), working [examples](https://github.com/emard/ulx3s-misc) and different [projects](https://ulx3s.github.io/).

The [main github page](https://ulx3s.github.io/) for ULX3S serves as the central hub for all resources and information related to the ULX3S ecosystem.

The ULX3S board is available in various models, differentiated primarily by their Look-Up Table (LUT) sizes, including 12F, 25F, 48F, and 85F variants, where the numbers indicate the LUT capacity, such as 85K LUTs, which will be used here. These boards can be synthesized, placed, and routed using either Lattice Diamond or open-source tools. However, for programming, the boards require open-source tools like fujprog or openFPGALoader. The design and layout of the board, along with its peripherals, are showcased in the illustrations below which show the front and back sides of the board, respectively.
