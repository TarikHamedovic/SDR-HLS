@W: MT529 :"/home/user/SDR-HLS/1.RTLImplementation/3.lattice/Version2/systemverilog/impl1/source/NCO.sv":35:2:35:10|Found inferred clock PLL|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 2675 sequential elements including nco_sig_inst.phase_accum[63:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
